The dirrhoeal disease cases were mainly caused by unsafe water which people in the district were using.\\n\\n“Realising that it is painful to lose a child to an easily prevented or cured ailment such as diarrhoea, Malawi Red Cross Society, the Government of Malawi and other stakeholders, with financial support from the Netherlands Red Cross, came together to embark on this project.\\n\\n“The project’s water and sanitation facilities were handled over to the communities so that they can run them on their own. As we are doing this, we urge communities to take care of the facilities so that they should also benefit generations to come,” said Ngulube.\\n\\nNgulube said the project mainly focused on four areas namely provision of improved water sources; promotion of hygiene and sanitation services; provision of diarrhoea drugs for early treatment and capacity building for the benefiting communities.\\n“Through the provision of improved water sources, the project rehabilitated and upgraded Phalombe Minor Gravity Water fed system to support about 20 communities. It also rehabilitated 45 boreholes and provided 2 200 water filters to some households and schools who still had no access to safe water sources.\\n“Also, on promotion of hygiene and sanitation, we constructed 80 latrines in eight schools, pit-emptied and repaired 20 latrines in two primary schools. We also constructed 20 urinals and 20 hand washing facilities for boys and girls in the same schools as well as eight latrines at Mpasa and Migowi health centres,” added Ngulube.\\n\\nPhalombe District Commissioner (DC) Harry Phiri, speaking in an interview, commended Malawi Red Cross Society by saying that the project has brought a number of fruits since its inception.\\n\\nPhiri cited how cases of waterborne diseases have gone down in the district, how women and girls are no longer travelling long distances to fetch water leaving their farms and homes unattended and how hygiene has improved in health centres and schools in the district.\\n\\n“The improved water supply is also helping at Migowi Health Centre where previously pregnant women and their guardians had to walk long distances in order to fetch water. Hygiene activities at the health centre have also been uplifted because of the provision of water. Washing of bed linen has also been simplified,” said Phiri.\\n\\nGuest of honor at the handover ceremony, Southern Region irrigation and water development officer Phideria Moyo also commended MRCS and Netherlands Red Cross for the project.\\nShe said though Phalombe is naturally blessed with water; it was a problem for communities to access clean and potable water because the available water is not clean and unsafe for drinking.\\n\\n“This project also came at a time when Malawi as a country and government is racing towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 which is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.\\nIn her remarks, T/A Mkhumba said the project has simplified her people’s lives. She said now people can access safe and potable water right in their communities.\\n\\n“Before this project, my subjects had to walk long distances to source for water which was usually not potable and was causing waterborne diseases. We are happy about this project and its benefits,” said the chief.\\n\\nAll the communities benefitting from the project also shared their chief's excitement by thanking Malawi Red Cross Society and Netherlands Red Cross.\",\n",

They will target the immediate needs of 7,660 households for nine months.\\nMRCS Secretary General Ethel Kaimila said today, “Our task right now is to ensure that people survive and to alleviate the appalling conditions so many are in. We must feed them, shelter them, ensure they have safe water and sanitation, and deal with the growing threat to their health. And when that is done we must help them to recover and resettle.”\\nHeavy rains have ceased for now but are forecast to return and could continue for weeks. “The chance of more flooding remains high,” said Michael Charles, IFRC’s acting regional representative in southern Africa. “A dire situation could be exacerbated. Things could go from bad to worse.” \\nFigures of how many people have been displaced still need to be verified but estimates suggest at least 174,000. The government estimates that in total 630,000 people have been affected. MRCS volunteers in displaced locations report that numbers are certainly growing as sodden houses collapse and more people emerge from the devastation.\\nGrossly inadequate shelter in the improvised camps to which people have fled, and the risk of epidemic disease, are major Red Cross concerns. With sources of water contaminated and sanitation poor, there is mounting fear of water-related sickness, and cholera is endemic. Malaria can be expected to spread with stands of stagnant water providing mosquitoes with breeding grounds. \\nSecretary General Kaimila says in one camp of 2,500 people she found 40 or 50 people sheltered in tents meant for no more than ten. Food distribution was intermittent and those 2,500 people had access to just four latrines. The camps are overcrowded and overwhelmed.\\nThe appeal seeks to fund operations providing food and shelter, safe water and sanitation, and health and care services. Red Cross volunteers would also reunite families the floods have separated. Across the devastated south, people lost sight of loved ones in the chaos of evacuation, and children now on their own in the makeshift camps is a Red Cross priority.\\nThe planned response reflects the current situation and will be adjusted in the light of new developments and more detailed assessments now being conducted by an IFRC Field Assessment Coordination Team (FACT).\\nAbout the Malawi Red Cross\\nThe Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) is Malawi’s oldest humanitarian organisation which started its operations in 1932 as the Nyasaland Branch of the British Red Cross. In 1966, the Malawi government passed Act 51 of Parliament establishing the MRCS as a voluntary society, allowing it the right to use the protected Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems in conformity with Geneva Conventions.

This contingency planning process is basically broken down into addressing three simple questions, which are: What is likely going to happen in light of weather or seasonal forecast? What are we going to do about it? And what can MRCS do ahead of time to get prepared?” Added Yonamu.\\n\\nIn line with the Malawi Government National Contingency Response plan, following the seasonal forecast which indicates that Malawi should expect normal to above normal rainfall amounts over the north and most of northern parts of central Malawi, while normal to below normal rainfall amounts over the south and most of southern parts of central Malawi during the 2018/2019 rainfall season, MRCS has prioritized Floods, Strong Winds, Cholera, Dry Spells.\\n\\nCivil unrest has also been targeted in the elections contingency plan due to General Elections taking place in May 2019.',\n",

The day was commemorated under theme “reducing economic losses from disasters has the power to transform lives”.\\n\\nThe United Nations General Assembly designated 13th October to celebrate the international day for disaster reduction to promote a global culture of disaster reduction, including disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness. Malawi as a nation has been prone to natural disasters since 1990’s. The development has indeed affected the economy and even lives of many Malawians.\\n\\nSharing the 2015 floods experience during the commemoration sideline event at Cross Roads hotel, MRCS disaster manager, Mr. Joseph Moyo said the year 2015 brought unforgettable moments to many lives and even the nation of Malawi. He further said that beside lack of sufficient funding, MRCS managed to support the victims affected by the disasters by providing them with food and shelter, among other things. \\n\\n“On 15th December 2017 there were heavy rains which caused flooding and about 1628 houses were destroyed and also 8173 people were affected” said the a Lilongwe Kaliyeka block leader. The block leader added that MRCS and other organizations came to their rescue by proving them with food and shelter.\\n\\nUN deputy resident coordinator who is also WFP Representative, Benoit Thiry said natural and man-made disasters are among the main drivers of hunger, malnutrition and poverty. He further said in the year of 2018, over 320 people have already been left homeless as a result of the heavy rains which destroyed their homes in Mzuzu.  He added that the 2016 El Nino induced food insecurity response coasted Malawi 395 million dollars to cover food, agriculture and other sector needs. This reflects on the costs of disasters and how much can be saved if such disasters are prevented. \\n\\nDeputy Mayor for Lilongwe city council, Juliana Kaduya said the Lilongwe city council has formulated bylaws which will deter people from constructing houses along the river banks. She further said if anyone will be found constructing a house in restricted areas it means he or she will be punished according to the laws. \\n\\nMinister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Cecilia Chazama who presided over the commemoration ceremony said this year’s theme has the power to transform lives.

When they are active participants, the change we are seeking will be easily achieved,’’ He points out. \\n\\nNazonse said in matters such as hygiene, any deviation by a single person, due to exclusion, may result in disaster for the whole village. ‘’ You know diseases spread from one person to another, if we leave out someone for any reason, including those with disability, that person may be the origin of the disease spread to the whole community,’’ he reasons. \\n\\nCommunity Resilience Project is being implemented in the three districts of Chikwawa, Mangochi and Mwaza with Health, Disaster, WASH, and Social Inclusion and Organizational development as focus areas. Currently 13910 households are being reached out in Mangochi alone.',\n",

Kanongodza said this during the opening of a one week long  FBF training that ended on Friday at Malawi Sun Hotel in Blantyre.\\n\\nKanongodza said much can be done to reduce the risk and impact of disasters and thus avoid unnecessary human suffering because FBF allows people to take a trigger based action such as moving to upland, stocking food, shelter and other relief items before disaster such as flood strike.\\n\\nAccording to one of the resource persons at the workshop, Irene Amuron, technical Advisor on Forecast Based Financing from the Red Cross Climate Center,  FbF consists of three important elements to enable early action. Amuron said first is a set of agreed triggers that determine when to take action, based on risk analysis and dynamic forecast monitoring, second are predefined actions to be taken when those triggers are met, based on roles and responsibilities for those actions enshrined in standard operating procedures, then a financing mechanism to automatically fund those actions with ease. \\n\\nThe overarching principle in Forecast Based Financing is that many more lives and livelihoods can be saved if people utilize the window of opportunity between forecast and the moment disaster strike to respond. FbF releases humanitarian funding based on forecast information for planned activities which reduce risks, enhance preparedness and response, and make disaster risk management overall more effective. \\n\\nAt the end of the workshop MRCS with technical assistance from the Danish Red Cross developed   trigger based action guide with thresholds and trigger-based actions and Forecast-based Financing Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs)Standard operating procedures to guide the implementation of FBF.',\n",

She fled to Bangula, where she joined others who had lost everything in Malawi’s worst floods in two generations. \\nFebbi now lives in the temporary camp in Bangula along with 6,000 others who have also lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods. Conditions are difficult for Febbi, a single mother of seven, who struggles daily to feed her children. All eight family members currently live in a tent provided by the Malawi Red Cross Society.\\nDespite the challenges she is facing, Febbi feels compelled to help other families who are sharing her struggle. Febbi has been a Red Cross volunteer for 12 years with the local Nsanje branch and the floods have not dampened her spirit of volunteerism. She has been working around the clock to assist those in need. Every day, she visits people in their tents, spreading hygiene promotion messages, checking if anyone is ill and needs care, and assisting camp managers with relief and food distribution. \\nShe reassures a camp resident who was in tears because she had missed out on a food distribution. Febbi explains that being asked for help is common, \"When people have a problem in the camp they come to the Red Cross volunteers. They come to us for health problems. They come if they have no food. They come for everything! They know we understand them and that we will try to help where we can.\"\\nNow Febbi faces a new challenge. Cholera has broken out in Nsanje and poses a significant threat to those displaced by the flood waters. It is vital to the health and survival of the camp residents that cholera does not spread into Bangula camp. \\nTo help with the prevention effort, Febbi is participating in cholera prevention training run by the Malawi Red Cross Society, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the Ministry of Health. The Red Cross is conducting the same training in four flood-affected districts, reaching 250 volunteers. \\nDuring her training, Febbi is learning the key hygiene messages that will help prevent the spread of cholera, the key symptoms of cholera, how and when to refer ill people for treatment, and the basic recommendations for preparing and administering oral rehydration solution, which is the first option for treatment. \\nThrough an emergency appeal, IFRC has been supporting the Malawi Red Cross Society to respond to the flood crisis since early January. With the reality of the situation becoming clear, and at least 230,000 now homeless because of the floods, IFRC has revised its emergency appeal and is now seeking 4 million Swiss francs to allow Red Cross volunteers to continue distributing tents and shelter materials, kitchen utensils, blankets and mosquito nets. Teams of staff and volunteers are also restoring water sources, desludging contaminated latrines and building new latrine facilities.  The appeal addresses the immediate needs of 46,712 displaced people, while also seeking to reduce the impact of the loss of crops and livelihoods, and help communities become more resilient to future floods. The appeal is currently 37 per cent funded.',\n",

Everybody laughs and start asking each other the places they have been to. It was only Judith who has been to Lilongwe some 40 kilomenters and non has ever travelled 400 kilometers down south to Zomba the current destination. This is the story of four young girls plucked from one of the poor rural Malawi to undergo a one and half year training in midwivery at Malawi College of Health Sciences in Zomba. Thanks to Korean Red Cross Society, Community Chest of Korea and Sumsang who have provided funding for their training.\\n \\nAt MRCS Ntchisi office: Rea Nzoma, Ruth Kasiya, Judith Mthawanji and Eunice Mangulu\\nMalawi Red Cross with technical and financial support from Korean National Red Cross Society, Community Chest of Korea and Sumsang is upgrading Mndimba and Sambakusi health posts to meet national standards to be able to provide maternal health services as part of the District Health System. At each site, the upgrading consists of training of midwives, construction of maternity wards and midwife houses, renovation of current infrastructures, construction of toilets, provision of solar lighting and supplies. The midwives training support includes all the fees, uniforms, education materials and transport to school. After completion of their studies the midwives will be recruited as civil servants and posted to the two health posts. A contract will be signed by the midwives that they will not leave the health post for a period of five years. Furthermore, there will be an MOU with the district council to ensure that there will be a midwife at the health post all the times.\\nEunice, at 19 years is the youngest. She together with  Ruth who is 25 years comes from Mndimba health post. During this interaction she was just smiling without saying anything. As the driver, Andrew Simon, was starting the engine she looked outside smile and tears drop out of her eyes. ‘I do not know how to say thank you to Red Cross,’ were her first words. ‘My father was retired from civil service due to sickness. Who could have given me one million five hundred thousand Malawi Kwacha to do my tertiary education.’ She asked apparently no one. Ruth just hugged her as if to comfort her. Ruth herself was a Red Cross volunteer at Mndimba health post. She says she is happy that women will no longer walk 30 kilometers to Chinguluwe Health Centre for maternal health services. ‘Women in my communty faces many problems when delivering babies and it pained me that all I could do is to provide health education when they are delivering without skilled midwives’. She said. Long distance to health centres and lack of adequate midwives are two major problems contributing to high maternal mortality in Malawi. Currently, the country’s maternal mortarity ratio is at 675 per 100,000 live births.\\n\\nRea (21 years)and Judith (26 years) from Sambakusi agreed with their colleagues that once they are trained in midwifery, there will be fewer deaths of mothers and babies due to pregnancy. Judith like Ruth were volunteers. Judith was a government growth monitoring volunteer. ‘I have seen women delivering at health centre with support from guardians since the midwife was assisting other mothers. How can one midwife deliver three babies at one time?’ She wondered. As they debated and joked about how it could be done, the Project Officer, Sam Kanyemba, reminded them that this is the very reason they were recruited for. All the girls assured Malawi Red Cross Society that they are ready to prevent maternal and infant deaths in their community.\\n\\nMalawi need more midwives. According to Lennie Kamwendo of the White Ribbon Alliance that advocates for safe motherhood, the midwife to patient ratio in Malawi is 1:272 while the recommended ratio is 1:5. The Program Manager, George Mwimaniwa, believes that support from Korean Red Cross, Community Chest of Korea and Sumsang will contribute to health system strengthening in Malawi.',\n",

So, when we linked up with TNM and its partners, they pulled their resources together to support the victims through Red Cross. \\n\\n“When the support came, we also thought of the people of Likoma who frequently face challenges because of the isolation of the district,” he said. \\n\\nHe said Red Cross also hopes that the speed boat worth about K4 million will address other emergency issues such as maternal and neonatal cases as well as issues of drowning. \\n\\nMaganga appealed to authorities to take care of the boat so that it serves the islands better. \\n\\n“As Red Cross, we support government initiatives and we work through volunteers. Sometimes when people are given support like this one, they may not value the importance of the donation. We are looking forward to volunteers taking care of the boat so that it may serve the purpose for a relatively longer period,” he said. \\n\\nLikoma district commissioner Charles Mwawembe said the district does not have a reliable means of transport. \\n\\n“Our transport system is programmed. We travel twice a week between Likoma and the mainland. This means that anything happening in between those days is a disaster. In fact, as residents of Likoma we are a disaster on our own,” he said. \\n\\nMwawembe said the district is also handicapped in emergency response, particularly when referring patients for further medical attention to the mainland. \\n\\nHe said the donation is worthwhile as it will address such challenges. \\n\\n“We have been lobbying with partners, well-wishers and donors if they could come and support us as a district. On our own we don’t have the capacity to own such facilities. \\n\\n“So, today is a great day for us to get the speed boat, specifically to assist us in areas of Red Cross activities to serve the two islands of Chizumulu and Likoma,” he said.',\n",

       "       '36 MRCS Volunteers and staff trained as NDRT\\n\\nFirst Aid, Shelter Construction, Camp Management, Disaster Assessment and Search and Rescue formed part of the National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) training organised by Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) for 36 Volunteers and staff.\\n\\nSpeaking on Friday in Lilongwe at the end of the First Aid training which is part of the NDRT training, Hastings Kandaya, MRCS Acting Secretary General who is also the Director of Programs said the objective of the training is to improve preparedness and response before, during and after disasters. On first Aid training Kandaya said the training has built capacity of the MRCS staff and volunteers, who can now serve lives by providing First Aid service. \\n\\n“The focus of NDRT training is generally on improving the technical skills of the participants, but also on personnel and team management. It aims to encourage and exchange of experience and knowledge and the creation of networks among the disaster managers. It also aims to improve coordination of disaster response and the quality and availability of disaster management tools,” Kandaya said.\\n\\n“Let me thank Malawi Defense Force for providing Search and Rescue training during the NDRT training and Community Resilience Project which funded the training with financial support from a consortium of Danish Red Cross, Finish Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross and Italian Red Cross.” Said  Kandaya. \\n\\nIn country Danish Red Cross delegate and consortium coordinator Kirstine Primdal said she was happy to see that the training was conducted. She said it was very important to have staff and volunteers trained in NDRT and First Aid in particular. She added that the skills will benefit the communities which we serve. “All over the world the Red Cross is well known as the largest first aid service provider and to have MRCS staff and volunteers who form part of the Red Cross movement, trained in first aid means that more and more lives will be served.” Said Kirstine.\\n\\nThe first Aid training was facilitated by MRCS Fisrt Aid National Master Trainer Alick Msusa. Msusa said he was pleased to note that more people are learning first Aid. He however urged individuals and Companies to get up to date first Aid training from MRCS which is the largest first Aid service provider in Malawi.\\n\\nNational Disaster Response Teams comprise of National Society staff and volunteers, often from different branches trained and working alongside Red Cross volunteers at community level to bring assistance to people affected by disaster.\\n\\nThey are made up of generalists and specialists in health, logistics, relief, disaster management and water and sanitation. NDRT can be mobilised at short notice and are trained to work as a team and support the local Red Cross branch in its response to disasters.',\n",
